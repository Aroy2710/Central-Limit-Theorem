# Central-Limit-Theorem-
Program that highlights how the Central Limit Theorem works using a 6 sided die

# How the Project Works 

* The main file is the CentralLimitTheoremVFinal which must be run in MATLAB.
* In order to use it properly you must have all the function and audio files in the same folder
* To see the central limit theorem in action I recommend varying the sample size in increasing order, i.e sample size : 10, then 100, then 1000, 10000 and so on , the histogram will become more and more normal with a larger sample size
* Keep the number of samples constant to a high value such as 10000
* You can choose either a histogram or a normal overlay to see the visualization and I have included other visualization such as box plot and line plots to see how the numerical value stabilizes to the true mean in the long run.
* There are other functionality I have added such as seeing summary statistics , generating a file containing all the sample means , seeing a visual gradient of all the means and seeing where certain proportions of data lie such at what range does 68/95/99.7% of the sample lie .
